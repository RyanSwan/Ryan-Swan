												<h3>Python Exam</h3>
											</header>
											Date: 1st November 2023<br />
											<br />
											<p>Had my first exam on the semester and I have to say it was an incredible experience. Learning a coding language is something that I have wanted to do for a long time now and the first six weeks of this semester has been a grind that I have taken in my stride. The exam consisted of the basics of python (input function was the first question), and working with libraries such as numpy and pandas. I do like numpy, however I think pandas is far more gripping and challenging. Manipulating dataframes is something I really find myself interested in. I think I did pretty well on the exam, although there was a functions question that I struggled with. Overall, I'm really happy with how the data analytics course is going so far!</p>

												<h3>Machine Learning Exam</h3>
											</header>
											Date: 29th November 2023<br />
											<br />
											<p>Today marked the second exam of the semester, this time it was for the MT413 module: 'Data Mining and Predictive Analytics'. This exam was composed of the various elements we have studied for the past two months, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms. At first, learning about the theory of these topics was quite intimidating to me, as they seemed to be very high level. However, I could not be happier with how that exam went! I'm very happy with how I cleaned the data, I knew how to implement dummy variables and an encoding dictionary, and my models had a high accuracy measure. Another step in the right direction!</p>

												<h3>Microsoft Experience</h3>
											</header>
											Date: 19th February 2024<br />
											<br />
											<p>Today marked a pivotal moment in our Business Analytics journey — our class had the privilege of attending an exclusive Power BI workshop hosted at Microsoft's headquarters, kindly organised my my classmate, Dami. It wasn't just another day of lectures; it was an immersive experience that introduced us to the transformative capabilities of data visualization and business intelligence.<br />
											The workshop began with a warm welcome from Microsoft's leading data analysts, who outlined the day's agenda filled with hands-on sessions and interactive learning. As we settled into the conference room, the vibrant energy was palpable. Our instructors for the day walked us through the intricacies of Power BI's interface, showcasing how this powerful tool could turn complex datasets into insightful, interactive dashboards. We then concluded with a Q&A session and some networking before we were shown around the complex. We got a picture as a class to cap off an incredible experience!

										<h2>Update on the course</h2>
									</header>
									Date: 2nd April 2024<br />
									<br />
									<p>Just got my results back for our Power BI presentation: 68%, which is a good score. I'm averaging 63% for this module, which I know will increase after the portfolio, which I am determined to do really well in. We are being taught how to create our GitHub website using HTML, another new form of code that I am excited to learn. I'm going to get my projects done nice and early, so I can have them ready to go when I start my portfolio.</p>

												<h3>Medium Daily Digest</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Throughout the year, I have been subscribed to Medium Daily Digest, which is a collection of emails that Medium send me. They have helped me learn many different aspects of business analytics, through my own interests of analytics for sport, and also with the tools we use throughout the year, like Power BI. The linked article was a very insightful read which helped me get a deeper understanding of how Power BI works, check it out!</p>

												<h3>Applying Elon Musk’s 5-Step Design Process to Business Analytics</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Elon Musk's 5-step design process, used at SpaceX, streamlines innovation and efficiency. It starts with refining requirements to ensure they're smart and owned by individuals, not departments. Then, it involves critically evaluating parts and processes to eliminate non-value adding elements. The third step is to simplify or optimize only after the first two steps have been executed. Accelerating the cycle time by focusing on one task is the fourth step, ensuring rapid execution of the right tasks. Finally, once the process is streamlined and optimized, it should be automated. This methodical approach encourages focusing on value and fast-paced innovation.</p>
