											<h2>Biography</h2>
										</header>
										<p>From my formative years as a secondary school student, my inclination towards analytical and business disciplines was clear. With a keen interest in subjects like applied mathematics, accounting, economics, and mathematics, I laid a solid foundation for my academic pursuits, honing my ability to analyse and strategize. These subjects, particularly for my Leaving Certificate, were stepping stones towards understanding my analytical mindset.</p>

										<p>When the time came to step into higher education, my analytical acumen was a guiding light, steering me towards a field where I could blend analytical aptitude with strategic thinking. Despite this clarity, choosing a definitive career path had a wide range of possibilities I wasn't ready to narrow down. I opted for Business Studies, a choice that helped me to keep a broad perspective, ensuring my educational journey was not limited to one field.</p>

										<p>It was within the vast expanse of Business Studies that I discovered a resonance with Data Analytics. This specialisation felt like a natural alignment with my skills and preferences. The practical, hands-on nature of data analytics, where trends are discovered and decisions are informed by data, appealed to me far more than the abstract world of essay writing. It was a domain where I could see patterns and influence decisions grounded in concrete analysis.</p>

										<p>Now, as I navigate my future, the path I want to follow has become clear. I aspire to delve deeper into the realm of Data Analytics through a 2-year graduate program, where I can further refine my skills and contribute to this dynamic field. My journey through secondary school's analytical rigor to my university's specialisation has been a testament to my dedication to this discipline. In pursuing a career in data analytics, I am not just following a profession; I am embracing who I am as a person, and following a career path I believe is suited to my nature. I am eager to explore the vast potentials of data and transform them into actionable insights that drive progress.</p>
